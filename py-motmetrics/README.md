# py-motmetrics

A python version of the evaluation scripts is maintained by Chrisoph Heindl
is available from [https://github.com/cheind/py-motmetrics](https://github.com/cheind/py-motmetrics)

Note that we have put some effort to align the evaluation scripts, the MATLAB version still remains the official one for the time being. We are not responsible for any deviations.
